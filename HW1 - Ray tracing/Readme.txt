Hello
please run ray_tracing.m
I created two modes (profile_flag=0 and profile_flag=1)

profile_flag=0: the speed-depth profile is completely linear like in the polar regien

profile_flag=1: the speed-depth profile is curvy and change its direction as shown in the attached image.
I used the community-builtin library called grabit to extract data points from the image and then parsed to MATLAB and augment the data to increase accuracy
